								<p class="p-title">Passion and Desire to Change People’s Lives </p>
								<p>The founder of International Training Academy, Dr. Natalia Doran, has more than 30 years of experience as a dermatologist in Europe, and as an Esthetics and Medical Assisting teacher in the United States. Her knowledge, medical education, practical experience, and passion make her uniquely qualified to provide unmatched standards of training in esthetics and health care.  </p>

								<p>She has spent many years trying to build the school of her dreams, which was founded in 2004, When asked what drives her, Dr. Doran speaks with conviction only a dedicated professional, who sacrificed her personal time off and vacations for four years has: “Passion and desire to change people’s lives”. Her hard work has paid off – Dr. Doran has trained hundreds of consummate skin care and health care professionals, many of whom went on to open their own successful businesses.  </p>
								<div class="clearfix"></div>
								<p>
									When Dr. Doran founded her school to fill the void in quality skin care education, she named it International Skin Beauty Academy. After many years of careful research, Dr. Doran has developed a number of outstanding skincare treatments, including the famous Age-Control Facial™, which she passes on her students. Together with a group of highly qualified, well educated, intelligent, and extremely motivated instructors, whom she personally trained, Dr. Doran developed an extremely successful esthetics program. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The Academy has also been dubbed the “School of Second Chances” for allowing women and men to finally pursue their passion and build a successful career. The students have come from near and far – both literally and metaphorically! We have trained women from almost 30 countries and are used to students driving from Indiana and Wisconsin to attend classes. But then students from other parts of the country - North Dakota, Arkansas, Virginia, Iowa and Florida - chose to move to Illinois to learn at the Academy. The list of current and former students includes licensed physicians, registered nurses, licensed estheticians, cosmetologists, and massage therapists. 
								</p>

								<p class="p-title">Next Level of Success</p>
								<p>
									After  establishing  its  reputation  as  one  of  the  best  skin  care  schools  in  the country,  and  changing  a multitude of lives for the better, we were ready to grow further and take it to the next level. The idea for the  new  direction  came  to  Dr.  Doran  after  she  started  attending  Chicago  Dermatological  Society meetings and round-tables at Rush and Cook County  hospitals. Many hospitals and doctors are looking (and struggling) to find well-trained employees who can perform a variety of functions at their practices. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Dr.  Doran  realized  that  training  in  both  Medical  Esthetics  and  Medical Assisting  would  be  a  unique opportunity  for  the  future  success.  Each  profession  itself  has  a  potential  for a  great  earning.  The combination would not only double a graduate’s income and give benefits; it would also make a person indispensable  to  the  medical  office  and  their  team.  The  Academy’s  outstanding  medical  programs include: Administrative and Clinical Medical Assisting, EKG, Phlebotomy, and Massage Therapy.

										At first I was very hesitant on where to go for aesthetics and medical assisting when finishing

college or if I should. I came across this school online and decided to go for an interview to see

the school and Doctor Doran. The minute I walked in, I was welcomed with open arms and had

all my questions answered. I decided to sign up for the programs. I just finished the aesthetics

program and could not be happier with my decision. Not only do you get the classroom

knowledge, but you get hands on training in the clinic each week from the teacher Mrs. Carrie.

Though what I loved the most is Dr.Doran who runs the school comes in and  teaches you on

days. She is not one to sit back, but rather wants everyone to be the best and teaches us to be. She

knows each student on a personal level, she becomes your teacher but best friend.  Your other

classmates are all different ages, ethic groups and past professions making you learn from them

and becoming a tight knit family. You are more than prepared for your boards as well!

										The M.A course is totally worth it and the instructors truly care about your success, I looked

forward to every class. They also help you out with an externship at Rush Hospital to get your

career started!

Yo tome la clase de asistente médico y vale la pena las instructoras de verdad se interesan en que

seas una persona exitosa, yo siempre estaba contenta de ir a cada clase. Te ayudan a que hagas

algunas horas de experiencia en el Hospital Rush para empesar con tu carrera!

										I am currently in the Medical Assistant program. This school I feel is very successful in helping

people find careers they love. I enjoy going to school every week, I love that we get to practice

on each other to help boost our confidence in what we will be doing in our careers. Also I love

how they set us up with an externship at Rush University to help with our experience in the field.

What drew me to the school was how short the program is, but you learn so much information,

and actually retain it. Also that everyone is so friendly and helpful. I really recommend this

school if you are interested in MA and, or Esthetics.

										I took the esthetics program and I am currently taking the medical assistant program I feel that

this school has greatly prepared me to advance my education and further my knowledge when I

Teachers and Dr. Doran for all that have taught me.

										I&#39;m taking the medical assisting program. Very glad i choose this school. Took me a while to get

back to school because the experiences I&#39;ve had at other vocational schools. Since day one i felt

welcomed and i continue to receive the same support and drive from the instructors. You can tell

they care about your success. I love the fact that the class is small because every single student

gets the attention of the instructors. From hands on training to medical book work. I&#39;m confident

that the time I&#39;ve spent here will have me ready for the career in the medical field.

						The decision to go back and finish school was of very great importance to me. When I came

across ITA, I knew it was the perfect fit, given my background in esthetics and my goals of

continuing my education in healthcare.<br>

The CMA program combines theory and clinical experience, which facilitates a balanced

education.  The material is presented in an organized and structured way, while still maintaining

a supportive environment. ITA guides and encourages you to reach your full potential and for

that I am ever grateful to Dr. Doran &amp; Ms. Helen.<br>

I am now even more motivated, confident and prepared to go forward with my career in

healthcare. Additionally, my overall experience has allowed me to develop more compassion and

understanding, which will be helpful in providing the best quality of care to future patients.

									<div class="item">Where do I begin?! I feel so lucky to have found such an incredible school with incredibly

knowledgeable teachers. I am a student in the esthetics program and will be graduating at the end

of February. I feel very prepared and confident in everything I&#39;ve learned. My plan after

graduation is to work in a dermatologist or plastic surgeon office. In order to be prepared for that

field, I will be participating in the Medical Assisting program (MA). During the MA program, I

will be working with Rush dermatology, which I am so excited about!
<br>
 

If you&#39;re interested in esthetics or medical assisting, ISBA is for you. You will get one on one

attention, meet new friends and learn to love everything to do with skin!

									I joined the International Training Academy (ITA) for the Medical Assisting program.<br>

Dr. Doran was very accommodating and I was happy they offer flexible class schedules (Day

and Night classes).<br>

ITA teaches you everything you need to learn, including EKG/ECG and Phlebotomy.<br>

They supported and guided us, helped us learn and practice over and over until we do it right.

We were like a family supporting each other to reach our full potential. I learned a whole lot not

only in the theoretical part but more on practical skills.<br>

With all the hands-on experience I learned, coupled with my organizational skills and ability to

multi-task, I am more confident and prepared for a fulfilling and rewarding career as a Clinical

Medical Assistant.<br>

Thank you Dr. Doran for the opportunity to be a part of your school. My gratitude to Ms. Helen,

our instructor for all her support, knowledge and dedication.

									With a million things going on at once in my life, I made a tough decision to go back to school. I

signed up for the Medical Esthetics and Medical Assisting Program and I have to say, it was the

best decision I ever made and also with choosing this school. With having 2 children, they have

day and evening programs available. This school is mostly hands on which is exactly what I

needed. Dr. Doran and the instructors are amazing, I can&#39;t say enough positive things about them.

Not only do they give you 150% of their effort to make you the best professional you can be, but

they are also like one big family! Thank you

									I attended this school over 2 years ago and I can tell you it was a great choice! I went for

Medical Asst and had no problem getting a job after I graduated. The staff and teachers are great,

and you finish your school in a short period of time which is nice. Because of this school I have a

wonderful job and career, and it was the best decision I made. I hope this review will help others

with deciding;) Good Luck to everyone out there, but make the right choice and choose this

									I finished my esthetics program last Friday at International Skin Beauty Academy and I am

confident and I am ready to provide superior services to my future clients!!  My time at ISBA

has been the best in that I was surrounded by my talented classmates  and I had the best teachers,

Dr. Doran, Ms. Kim, Ms. Carrie, and Anastasia.  They all pushed me to be the best esthetician

									I am about to finish school at ISBA in one week.  One week!  I can&#39;t believe it.  Someone pinch

me!  This has been a 10 year dream of mine!   I am so excited and so proud of myself and the

other students finishing next week.  We have worked so, so hard.  All we have left is the state

board exam in April!
<br>
I needed to take the time and write about ISBA for they have helped me make this dream of mine

be the best, they are passionate, supportive, and caring along the way.  Because of this,  I feel so

accomplished and strong in my facial and waxing abilities. I feel like I am one of the best.   I am

confident in my skills and I think that is what you want in a school.  I am ready to work in even

the best spas.  Dr. Doran and her staff are perfectionists but they make you be THE BEST you

can possibly be.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

									I usually never post reviews but this school is too good to be kept a secret. I just got my exam

result and guess what I passed!! I will be a Licensed Esthetician soon, and it&#39;s all because of

ISBA!! I can&#39;t describe in words how much I loved the school, the teachers and everyone else I

met there. They are the best when it comes about skin care. All the teachers have great passion

for what they do and they inspire the same feeling in you. So by the time I finished the school I

									Being professional make-up artist working on commercial productions and weddings for over 15

years, I have always had a passion for skin care. Although I have obtained a college degree, I

have always wanted my license in esthetics so that I could provide additional skin care services

to my clients.  <br>

Because I am very particular, I wanted the best school around.  I knew that Dr. Doran and ISBA

would be a perfect fit for me because of their advanced curriculum, unique techniques, and hand-

on learning approach to esthetics.<br>

Today, I am grateful for the education that I have received through ISBA and for my extremely

knowledgeable and dedicated instructors that helped me rise to the top of the industry

									This is an Esthetics School and also a Spa.  It is just north of Woodfield Mall and you can get spa

services for next to nothing.  Services include facials, and all waxing services and most times

depending on what waxing you need, it will probably be free!  The student are very good and the

place is very clean.  High standards and great location.  Check it out, you won&#39;t be

disappointed!!!
