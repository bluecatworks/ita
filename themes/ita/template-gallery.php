										At first I was very hesitant on where to go for aesthetics and medical assisting when finishing

college or if I should. I came across this school online and decided to go for an interview to see

the school and Doctor Doran. The minute I walked in, I was welcomed with open arms and had

all my questions answered. I decided to sign up for the programs. I just finished the aesthetics

program and could not be happier with my decision. Not only do you get the classroom

knowledge, but you get hands on training in the clinic each week from the teacher Mrs. Carrie.

Though what I loved the most is Dr.Doran who runs the school comes in and  teaches you on

days. She is not one to sit back, but rather wants everyone to be the best and teaches us to be. She

knows each student on a personal level, she becomes your teacher but best friend.  Your other

classmates are all different ages, ethic groups and past professions making you learn from them

and becoming a tight knit family. You are more than prepared for your boards as well!

										The M.A course is totally worth it and the instructors truly care about your success, I looked

forward to every class. They also help you out with an externship at Rush Hospital to get your

career started!

Yo tome la clase de asistente médico y vale la pena las instructoras de verdad se interesan en que

seas una persona exitosa, yo siempre estaba contenta de ir a cada clase. Te ayudan a que hagas

algunas horas de experiencia en el Hospital Rush para empesar con tu carrera!

										I am currently in the Medical Assistant program. This school I feel is very successful in helping

people find careers they love. I enjoy going to school every week, I love that we get to practice

on each other to help boost our confidence in what we will be doing in our careers. Also I love

how they set us up with an externship at Rush University to help with our experience in the field.

What drew me to the school was how short the program is, but you learn so much information,

and actually retain it. Also that everyone is so friendly and helpful. I really recommend this

school if you are interested in MA and, or Esthetics.

										I&#39;m taking the medical assisting program. Very glad i choose this school. Took me a while to get

back to school because the experiences I&#39;ve had at other vocational schools. Since day one i felt

welcomed and i continue to receive the same support and drive from the instructors. You can tell

they care about your success. I love the fact that the class is small because every single student

gets the attention of the instructors. From hands on training to medical book work. I&#39;m confident

that the time I&#39;ve spent here will have me ready for the career in the medical field.

						The decision to go back and finish school was of very great importance to me. When I came

across ITA, I knew it was the perfect fit, given my background in esthetics and my goals of

continuing my education in healthcare.<br>

The CMA program combines theory and clinical experience, which facilitates a balanced

education.  The material is presented in an organized and structured way, while still maintaining

a supportive environment. ITA guides and encourages you to reach your full potential and for

that I am ever grateful to Dr. Doran &amp; Ms. Helen.<br>

I am now even more motivated, confident and prepared to go forward with my career in

healthcare. Additionally, my overall experience has allowed me to develop more compassion and

understanding, which will be helpful in providing the best quality of care to future patients.

									<div class="item">Where do I begin?! I feel so lucky to have found such an incredible school with incredibly

knowledgeable teachers. I am a student in the esthetics program and will be graduating at the end

of February. I feel very prepared and confident in everything I&#39;ve learned. My plan after

graduation is to work in a dermatologist or plastic surgeon office. In order to be prepared for that

field, I will be participating in the Medical Assisting program (MA). During the MA program, I

will be working with Rush dermatology, which I am so excited about!

If you&#39;re interested in esthetics or medical assisting, ISBA is for you. You will get one on one

attention, meet new friends and learn to love everything to do with skin!

									I joined the International Training Academy (ITA) for the Medical Assisting program.<br>

Dr. Doran was very accommodating and I was happy they offer flexible class schedules (Day

and Night classes).<br>

ITA teaches you everything you need to learn, including EKG/ECG and Phlebotomy.<br>

They supported and guided us, helped us learn and practice over and over until we do it right.

We were like a family supporting each other to reach our full potential. I learned a whole lot not

only in the theoretical part but more on practical skills.<br>

With all the hands-on experience I learned, coupled with my organizational skills and ability to

multi-task, I am more confident and prepared for a fulfilling and rewarding career as a Clinical

Medical Assistant.<br>

Thank you Dr. Doran for the opportunity to be a part of your school. My gratitude to Ms. Helen,

our instructor for all her support, knowledge and dedication.

									With a million things going on at once in my life, I made a tough decision to go back to school. I

signed up for the Medical Esthetics and Medical Assisting Program and I have to say, it was the

best decision I ever made and also with choosing this school. With having 2 children, they have

day and evening programs available. This school is mostly hands on which is exactly what I

needed. Dr. Doran and the instructors are amazing, I can&#39;t say enough positive things about them.

Not only do they give you 150% of their effort to make you the best professional you can be, but

they are also like one big family! Thank you

									I attended this school over 2 years ago and I can tell you it was a great choice! I went for

Medical Asst and had no problem getting a job after I graduated. The staff and teachers are great,

and you finish your school in a short period of time which is nice. Because of this school I have a

wonderful job and career, and it was the best decision I made. I hope this review will help others

with deciding;) Good Luck to everyone out there, but make the right choice and choose this

school for your education.

									I finished my esthetics program last Friday at International Skin Beauty Academy and I am

confident and I am ready to provide superior services to my future clients!!  My time at ISBA

has been the best in that I was surrounded by my talented classmates  and I had the best teachers,

Dr. Doran, Ms. Kim, Ms. Carrie, and Anastasia.  They all pushed me to be the best esthetician

and they explained the material clearly so that I understood it.  They are all passionate about

what they do, energetic, inspiring, and caring.  I am so happy and thankful that I chose ISBA.

 Thank you so much!!!

									I am so glad my family suggested I go back to school, ISBA was a great choice! It worked

perfectly with my daily schedule. I&#39;m so looking forward to helping others with their skin care

needs. Dr. Doran and her staff have made a big difference in my experience in school. They have

changed my life. My next big step is the state test and with the preparation I received from them,

I am more than confident I will do well. I will miss all the teachers and classmates! Looking

forward to the schools continuing education classes.

									I am about to finish school at ISBA in one week.  One week!  I can&#39;t believe it.  Someone pinch

me!  This has been a 10 year dream of mine!   I am so excited and so proud of myself and the

other students finishing next week.  We have worked so, so hard.  All we have left is the state

board exam in April!
<br>
I needed to take the time and write about ISBA for they have helped me make this dream of mine

a reality.  Dr. Doran and her staff LOVE this field and their students.  Though they push you to

be the best, they are passionate, supportive, and caring along the way.  Because of this,  I feel so

accomplished and strong in my facial and waxing abilities. I feel like I am one of the best.   I am

confident in my skills and I think that is what you want in a school.  I am ready to work in even

the best spas.  Dr. Doran and her staff are perfectionists but they make you be THE BEST you

can possibly be.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

 The instructors are genuine.  Thank you ITA!!!  Love you Dr. Doran!!

									Dr. Doran, Ms. Kim &amp; Ms. Rasa all gave me the knowledge and techniques needed to become

one the best Estheticians. Dr. Doran is so loving, outgoing and truly cares about her students

needs! You become apart of the ISBA family as soon as you become a student. All of the

teachers reassure all of the girls how intelligent we are &amp; how much they love us. It&#39;s so nice to

hear! I truly enjoyed all of my time spent here as a student as well as an intern. I did not have to

look around at other schools, I knew ISBA was the perfect school for me. As a student you will

feel extremely confident taking all the tests within the curriculum as well as the state licensing

test. Thank you to all staff at ISBA!!!

									I usually never post reviews but this school is too good to be kept a secret. I just got my exam

result and guess what I passed!! I will be a Licensed Esthetician soon, and it&#39;s all because of

ISBA!! I can&#39;t describe in words how much I loved the school, the teachers and everyone else I

met there. They are the best when it comes about skin care. All the teachers have great passion

for what they do and they inspire the same feeling in you. So by the time I finished the school I

had great knowledge and not only, I have the confidence to go out there and claim I know how to

do my job.  Even after school I still go there sometimes, I always enjoy being there and always

feels like home. Thank you my dear teachers, I am so grateful to know you!!! Thank you Dr

Doran!!!!!

									Being professional make-up artist working on commercial productions and weddings for over 15

years, I have always had a passion for skin care. Although I have obtained a college degree, I

have always wanted my license in esthetics so that I could provide additional skin care services

to my clients.  <br>

Because I am very particular, I wanted the best school around.  I knew that Dr. Doran and ISBA

would be a perfect fit for me because of their advanced curriculum, unique techniques, and hand-

on learning approach to esthetics.<br>

Today, I am grateful for the education that I have received through ISBA and for my extremely

knowledgeable and dedicated instructors that helped me rise to the top of the industry

									This is an Esthetics School and also a Spa.  It is just north of Woodfield Mall and you can get spa

services for next to nothing.  Services include facials, and all waxing services and most times

depending on what waxing you need, it will probably be free!  The student are very good and the

place is very clean.  High standards and great location.  Check it out, you won&#39;t be

disappointed!!!
