							<h3>About Our Student Spa</h3>
							<p>All procedures are performed by advanced students under the supervision of instructors. Each skin care student has to pass a practical evaluation, to ensure that they are ready to provide services at the highest professional level!
							The experience also gives our students a significant advantage in the eyes of employers by gaining extensive professional expertise – and allows our clients to receive high-quality services at an affordable price.
							We are extremely proud to announce that the profits from the procedures are donated to charity! Some of the non-profit organizations with whom we have been involved are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="#">The American Red Cross</a></li>
								<li><a href="#">The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a></li>
								<li><a href="#">Marklund</a></li>
								<li><a href="#">Hemophylia Foundation of Illinois</a></li>

							<h3 class="bold">Radiant Peeling Treatment ($50.00)</h3>
							<p>Experience the ultimate exfoliation! A fruit acid removes surface cells and gives your skin a fresh, revitalized appearance! This advanced potent yet gentle treatment delivers powerful, age-defying results: it unclogs the pores, diminishes surface wrinkles, and promotes a smoother, evenly-toned complexion. A series of at four weekly treatments is recommended.</p>

							<h3 class="bold">Diamond Microdermabrasion ($35.00)</h3>
							<p>An advanced method of exfoliating and gently resurfacing the skin, this procedure is easy, painless and effective. Diamond-based treatments produce none of the dangerous dust that results from crystals and allow us to work on the delicate eye area and skin around the lips (usually where the first fine lines and wrinkles appear). This procedure should be performed on a consistent basis to achieve and maintain best results.</p>
